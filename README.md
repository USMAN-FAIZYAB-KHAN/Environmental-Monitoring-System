# Environmental-Monitoring-System
## Description
The Environmental Monitoring System is a C-based project that integrates with a free API to retrieve real-time environmental data, process and analyze the data, store it, generate reports, automate tasks using shell scripts, optimize efficiency through dynamic memory allocation, and implement real-time alerts. This project aims to provide hands-on experience with contemporary technologies in computer engineering and fulfill the specified learning outcomes.

## Installation
Ensure a C compiler (like GCC) is installed.
Clone/download the source files.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run weather_monitoring.sh (make it executable with chmod +x weather_monitoring.sh).

## Usage
Execute ./weather_monitoring.sh to compile and run the program.
The program fetches and displays weather data automatically.
